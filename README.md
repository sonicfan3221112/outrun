# outrun

### Summary

Outrun is a custom server for Sonic Runners, reverse engineered from the [Sonic Runners Revival](https://sonic.runner.es/) project.

### Goals

  - Implement all non debug endpoints as fulfilled by the original server
  - Maintain speed throughout runtime
  - Consume little resources for conservative deployment

### Current functionality

Notable:
  - Timed Mode
  - Roulette Wheel Kinda
  - Story Mode (Functional, in progress)
  - Ring/Red Star Ring keeping
  - Functional shop
  - Character/Chao equipping
  - Character leveling and progression

Functional:
  - Android and iOS support
  - High score keeping
  - Notifications (pending revamp)
  - Ticker notices
  - Small database size and memory footprint
  - Low CPU usage
  - Descriptive error reporting and handling

### Building

1. [Download and install Go 1.12](https://golang.org/dl/) (project tested on Go 1.12.4)
2. [Download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (for `go get`)
3. Set your [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH) environment variable
4. Open a terminal/command prompt
5. Use `cd` ([Windows,](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) [Linux/macOS](https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html)) to navigate to a directory of choice
6. Run `go get github.com/fluofoxxo/outrun` and wait until the command line returns
7. Run `go build github.com/fluofoxxo/outrun` and wait until the build is complete
8. Run the produced executable (`outrun.exe` on Windows, `outrun` on Linux/macOS)

Binary releases may be provided in more mature stages of the repository.

### Misc.

Any pull requests deemed code improvements are strongly encouraged. Refactors may be merged into a different branch.
